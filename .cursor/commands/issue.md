- the goal here is to create a new github issue based on a feature development plan produced from plan mode
- the github token is in the .env file load GITHUB_PAT as an evironment variable and pass it to the github API
- make sure the clear token does not appear in any logs
- before creating the issue check for uncommitted code, outside the .cursor folder
- when there is uncommitted code ask user to commit or revert changes, do not open the issue
- create issue with markdown development plan
- create a mew branch starting with the issue number and a very short description e.g. 12_licence, 34_barchart (all lower caps)
- switch to new branch
