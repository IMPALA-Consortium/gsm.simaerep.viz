- do not write any non-standard documentation as *.md files
- be short and concise prioritize conciseness over grammar


# Outline
- the goal is to create a new version of https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.viz
- gsm.viz is used as a htmlwidget in https://github.com/Gilead-BioStats/gsm.kri
  - creates a html report with widgets created by gsm.viz using data generated in R
  - common selector for clinical trial sites which highlights the same site across all visible plots
- if possible add gsm.viz to it as a dependency
- reuse code from src/util if necessary
- add a new charttype which is just a list of sites that supports gsm.viz site selection functionality

- subsequently add more chart types, we will do this at a later point in time

- this is only a JS library
- we start with only a cahrt list of sites
- we need a testing framework the same gsm.viz is using
- we start with the github gsm.viz dependency


- we will use a git based workflow:
  - create issues for implementation steps
  - create branch for each issue
  - iterate locally until all tests are passing
  - update issues if necessary
  - create PR with main
  - merge with main branch when ci/cd is passing

- copy gsm.viz sample data structure add a source data file with site_names, make up some random IDs
